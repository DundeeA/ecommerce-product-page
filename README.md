## My process
I started this project by drawing a small wireframe over the original design with the different html5 elements I wanted to include for the sake of semantic mark up. I continued development by breaking the project into several small task that eventually lead to the finished product. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Jquery
- Mobile first design

### What I learned
I took this challenge on as an opportunity to learn SASS, I also decided to get more practice with Jquery, I definitely got some good practice in with both.
